This snake game is inspired by John Taieb's snake game project in his course on
'Udemy' named 'Formation Complète Développeur Web. His project has only one (1)
version (closed mode) and has no home page.

Based on his source code, I created two (2) versions of the game --an open mode
(snake_open_mode_script.js) and a closed mode (snake_closed_mode_script.js)
--both accessible from a home page (snake_home_page.html) and differently designed
compared to Taieb's.

All the images used in this project are from 'Google'.
